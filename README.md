DnD based game (text and simple GUI)

Work in progress, the goal is to create a game where you can generate a Dungeons&Dragons ed5.0/5.5 character and fight against AI that utilize complex behaviour tree and in future maybe some limited ML/DL models.

Current status:
v1.0
1. Auto-generated map, board default 35x35
2. Simple behaviour tree for AI actions (ranged and melee behaviours)
3. GUI for playing game
4. Method for creating/equipping characters
5. Move/Attack etc. methods implemented compliant with DnD 5.5 rules
